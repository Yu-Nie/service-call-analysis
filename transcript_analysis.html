          Hello. Hey, Luis. Got you all done. The reason that took so long is I.
          I just kind of also built all your equipment options when I was out
          there too. Okay, sure. I'd love to wrap up with you here. Of course,
          of course. So what are you up to for the rest of the day? Oh, keep
          working. Yeah, yeah, most of the. Most of the day. Sometimes I go
          through. I literally can't work from anywhere else but your home. I
          know. Yeah. AI is a big thing, man. But so just to. Let's go right to
          just the differences here. I just wanted to show you.

          So remember before how we had that before that below freezing
          temperature at 41. It's good to see. And now we have that 20 degree
          difference as well. Did a really fancy charge there for you and got
          you in good shape. All that to say. Definitely. Bandaid. Sure. Yeah.
          It is old. It's an old unit. Right. So when it comes to just what to
          expect here in the future, I would say month to two months. I think
          we'll start to see. Or even sooner we'll start to see the efficiency
          drop again. And we still have those mold issues. I did just want to
          show you some different equipment options. Of course.

        <p>
          Yeah. So the two equipment options, or there's a total of four that I
          built. There's either we replace like for like, which will naturally
          be more efficient, even though it's just going to be the updated
          version of what you have. It's going to be a new furnace, new coil,
          new condenser, higher sear rating, better efficiency, but still like
          the same type of equipment. The next step beyond that is maintaining
          gas heating, electric cooling, but upgrading efficiency. And the
          interesting thing about that is that actually ends up being the most
          expensive one of the four that I've built. Are you familiar with
          natural gas phase outs? No. Okay. So it is something like, let's say,
          for instance, we have stove tops being phased out. We do have gas
          water heaters being phased out. We have gas furnaces being phased out.
          Are you familiar with what California's goal is in every. Yeah, some
          of that. Yeah, I like the idea. It's just kind of a lot. They want
          every house to have a 200amp panel, have a bathtub generator. They
          want every house to have solar, and they want every house to have a
          heat pump. And so heat Pumps are the next option. Yeah, heat pumps are
          actually just got introduced some more rebates.
          <strong>So even though those are the best possible system to install,
            weirdly enough, those actually are getting quite affordable at the
            moment. I'm used to them being actually our most expensive option.
            But rebates have been introduced that have made it a lot more
            reasonable.
          </strong>
          And then when it comes to the. The two different heating options, I
          just have two different types of heat pumps that I'm building for you.
          So let's just look at. I like to like higher efficiency and then two
          different. Still same technology and then two heat pumps. Exactly. And
          so to start off with, it's always important to realize these are more
          expensive than investments than your normal investment into a home.
          <strong>So I just wanted you to understand that a lot of our clients do use
            different monthly options to take care of them.</strong>
          But let's just break down what we do. So let's start off with the like
          for like we always come with our guarantees. We have some really,
          really excellent guarantees that really just show you that we're going
          to do a great job for you.

        <p>
          We then start off with our first cost. This is a newest nest
          thermostat. We can switch this up. I just wanted to just simplify it,
          put something in that you guys are used to. It will be just the most
          modern version. And then we credit this back towards replacement at
          the very end. So this 549 will be credited back towards you. Then we
          talk about steps like what we need to do. AC removal, hall away and
          disposal, heater and removal. This is a really lengthy section. This
          is like typically roughly one day, this amount of work we remove,
          safely, demolish and dispose of your furnace, remove safely, remove
          the refrigerant, demolish and dispose of your ac. And that's I think
          like a pretty lengthy section. Got it. This next one may or may not
          come up, but I am including it as a line item just in case it becomes
          relevant. Sometimes when we have water damage, I do see decayed
          plywood in sections where there could be like mold growth or anything
          like that. If we're seeing anything like that, we just cut that
          plywood out and put new plywood in. Okay. That's in the inside. Oh
          yeah. Next. The new system is not going to be the same dimensions.
          It's going to be a little bit smaller or a little bit wider, a little
          bit taller or something around there. And we do have to make sure the
          sheet metal connections fit to it. We do any sheet metal necessary. Of
          course. Outside we have A fuse box. That's where I remove it and work
          on it safely. We just put a new one in for you. All the new
          electrical. There will be some new electrical in there. Currently
          there's a little on off switch in there called a safety shut off. We
          always come with a new one. Any new thermostat, wiring or connections,
          any new electrical whips, we install that for you. We have circuit
          breakers on the ac. We just prefer to have a brand new circuit
          breaker. So we just include that with it. Thermostat wire,
          communication wire. This just means if there is a need to rerun a
          thermostat wire, we absolutely would. And then H Vac permanent. We
          always pull permits. There is a caveat for permit pulling. Usually
          they like to do a HERS test as well. Have you ever heard of that
          before? No, I don't know what the HERS test is. It's like an
          efficiency. It's a home efficiency test. And I do know right now your
          home would not pass a HERS test because of the condition of the
          ducting and a little bit of your insulation too. So we love to do HERS
          tests. But in order for us to feel confident in doing that, we would
          need to do a little bit with your ducting or consider modifying it.
          What that would look like is something.
          <strong>We do have a promotion going on currently is sealing your ductwork,
            which just means no replacement.</strong>
          But we go to every single connection and seal it thoroughly and then
          we can include a test. If we do that next. This is the total cost of
          four R&amp;E discounts.

          I do have a fair amount of discounts that I've included. This is again
          the like for like option. And just to explain what it comes with, I
          explained R410A. The refrigerant got phased out. We have the newest
          style here, R32. This is basically just the new standard for
          refrigerant. It is considered to be better for the environment.
          <strong>It's just much less harmful to ozone layers in general. 35% cooling
            savings, 30% heating savings.</strong>
          It is going to be the same similar type of technology. The sear rating
          is up. You currently have a 12 seer. We install a 15 and then we
          always include standard filtration for you as basic.
          <strong>The motor is an improvement. So the fan motor inside of the system
            is an improvement. Way more reliable and way quieter.</strong>
          That's basically what this comes with now.
          <strong>A really cool thing. 10 year manufacturer warranty, 10 year
            compressor warranties. If you're on this maintenance program with
            us, we actually completely match the manufacturer warranties. It's
            essentially 10 years parts and 10 year manufacturer
            warranty.</strong>

          And then moving on, we'll just get to the first heat pump. Really very
          similar line items. I'm not going to go through every single one this
          time. I wanted to pause at this one though. The technology we're
          talking about with this heat pump is called an inverter. Have you ever
          heard of an inverter before? I have, yeah. Actually, you know what? I
          saw your mini split. It actually mimics that technology, but in a
          ducted sense. So that's a ductless heating and cooling system. This
          one we have that same type of inverter technology where it ramps up
          and ramps down, except we're just attaching it to the ductwork. So the
          main difference here just important to realize that it's going to heat
          and cool a little bit differently.
          <strong>In general, everything is going to be an improvement. Cooling will
            be significantly better. Usually we're talking like 60% utility bill
            savings.</strong>
          The thing about heating side, it's just important to note usually they
          don't absolutely kill it the same way old furnaces do. Old furnaces
          have flames. So obviously we're going to get really intense
          temperature coming out. These do heat a little bit less extreme, but
          still are totally capable of. I'm familiar with the heat pump. You
          know about these? Okay, perfect. Everything else is the same. AC
          removal, hallway disposal, heater removal, plywood circuit breaker,
          thermostat permit.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="comment-box">
        <textarea placeholder="Your comment here...">again, nice to mention the benefits of the new system, and using the numbers to make it more appealing.</textarea>

    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph-group">
      <div class="transcript-text">
        <p>
          And there's the price before any discounts or rebates.
          <strong>We then have our discounts and rebates, which I realize I didn't
            include on the other option here.</strong>
          But starting off, this existed on your other estimate too, is $1,800
          off because we're able to reuse the copper line set. Very resilient to
          timing corrosion. If my install crew does determine that your H Vac
          leak that you have right now is in your copper line, we just still
          take care of it. But even with this savings in place, next, we have
          the thermostat credit back towards you. And this is where we have some
          rebates. So Silicon Valley Clean Energy. I did just want to confirm,
          did you opt out of this program? You would have to manually opt out of
          it. Yeah, I didn't. Okay, so you're good. So Silicon Valley Clean
          energy is a $2,500 off towards heat pump updates. Next we have tech
          which is one that just barely got reintroduced like yesterday. So
          that's, that's really cool that it got introduced. And 1500 off here.
          What this is is the fact that we're removing both a furnace and AC
          qualifies you for this higher end one. So we handle what we need to
          handle. There are things that you need to physically go in and do. The
          only one for the SVCE is you do. And this will be in a contract that
          you can just click on easily. You do need to submit a full PG and E
          bill. Like every bit, every page off a PG and E bill, and then we do
          the rest. What they need from us is proof that we've installed a
          inverter system and the manufacturer label. We take care of that. Got
          it. For tech. Let's see. I think we just take care of this one for
          you, so. Oh, you know what? This one does require a HERS test to be
          done.
          <strong>So for this area, I would love to include one of our promotions for
            you, which is where we just include a duct seal.</strong>
          And that would be something I can definitely do. So if that passes a
          HERS test, I think you're all good. Mm. So your client has clear
          record with the city. Yeah. As long as you have no failed permits,
          then it should pass. Failed permits, meaning like, you tried to pull a
          permit and it didn't work or passed. It didn't pass inspection. I see.
          I see. For this. For your homework. For your homework. Because there
          was something. Okay, no problem. Okay. So it looks like you would
          qualify for this. The next option will go to. And what was that
          option? Oh, total price. No, no. What was that option that you showed
          me? I. Yep. So you can actually see what's kind of funny is it's
          relatively around the same price as a gap and actually a little bit
          less expensive, weirdly.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="comment-box">
        <textarea placeholder="Your comment here...">two things can be improved here: 1. the technician didn't put the discounts and rebates, on the total price before showing the client. It's better to use a clear, ordered breakdown (e.g., “Here’s the price, now let me walk you through the discounts step by step”) and summarize total savings at the end to reinforce the value. 2. here the technician mentioned the duct seal promotion, but didn’t bring the benefits of it, like the efficiency and the savings, client may not consider it as a valuable option.</textarea>

          And what's really cool, I was actually talking to Alex that I was really impressed. I just built your best possible heat pump. This is like our branded unit. It's a daikin. Daikin we love to work with because they really like us. If you ever look up daikin products on Google and you look up, like, install videos, you'll actually see my company installing them because we do the worldwide training for how to install daikin, so we just have a great partnership with them. So we like to install them. But what's interesting is Bryant does have a corner on a type of technology. Heat pumps, on occasion enter a defrost cycle, which is where it briefly stops heating and it just runs itself alone to heat itself back up. These are known to not really enter that. And the brilliant. And it's just because of the way their coils are built, they have a better Type of metal derivative in it that is better at dissipating its own heat and keeping itself warm. Warm. The only time these ever enter defrost, which we won't ever get to here in California, Is when they enter 18 degrees Fahrenheit. So it just won't happen. And it's just really funny if we look at like the really high end furnace. It's just like. We really climbed the cost. I just. It's substantial. None of this option is moving the unit to the top. No. Currently I haven't built that. We do have an attic package. I would actually have to modify these estimates to do that.

          The reason I'm starting like this is just. I just wanted you to
          understand what it would look like to keep it in the closet. So when
          it comes to keeping it in the closet, we are completely fine moving it
          to your attic. Completely fine. The thing I like to make sure my
          clients understand is serviceability, maintenance and efficiency. That
          is the best location. Yeah. Because it's too hot up there. Precisely.
          What about moving it to the garage? That would be way harder. Harder.
          Harder. So much more work. And we would actually be forced to replace
          your ductwork entirely. And. And with this. The benefit of moving out
          to the attic, though, is you do get a full closet. In general, it is a
          pretty. In regards to airflow that enters the home, It's a pretty nice
          spot. It's just we do have to do some modifications. So just to
          explain an attic install, that intake would no longer be used. We
          would add one probably close to the center of the house. And our
          systems are very quiet. But it is just something that we will have
          airflow here now. And then we do have to run some new electrical. If
          we're not doing a new gas line, that's great. But we do have to
          install. We would have to install the intake here. And yeah. Closet
          systems, in regards to what the system itself likes is the best
          location. But at the end of the day, the systems are built for you. So
          if we're moving it to the attic completely fine. I kind of forget at
          the top of my head how much it adds to the project. It is depending on
          the severity of necessary. I do think it adds at least 4,000 to it.
          But on the highest end, it would involve new ductwork. And then we add
          a fair amount to it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. What we don't like about it
          there is not so much the cabinet is the noise. So the sway client or
          any of our units, that noise would be better. And what I can even do
          as an extra way to make that noise even better is if we swap the
          grill. So the grill right now has louvers. Right. So when an airflow
          is pulled in and it does this, that naturally creates noise. We can
          install an egg carton version that has a square squares instead. And
          it's much, much, much, much better for airflow. And when that happens,
          it makes it a lot quieter, too. I did do a test one time on no change
          other than the grill, and it did decrease noise by 20% when I did
          that. So 20% quieter, it would still get on the noise. Not. It would
          be much less noisy than this. But if we did do the basic furnace,
          that's not going to be as quiet. But if we talk about inverters, those
          actually can sometimes be hard, at least even on type of thing. Do you
          even hear it running? That makes sense. I can hear it with the split
          unit. Yeah. So, yeah, that technology gets introduced here. All that
          to say if there's an inclusive, incredible cooling demand, it still
          will pull a lot of airflow into itself, but that won't happen that
          consistently. It would happen when it breaks 100 or when it's 105.
          Then it might be. It'll still be quieter than that, but it will get to
          like equivalent air pressure going across itself.

        <textarea placeholder="Your comment here...">Phrases like “completely fine,” “harder, harder,” “pretty nice spot,” “I kind of forget,” “what I can even do,” and “yeah, that technology gets introduced” sound unprofessional or uncertain. The technician says a lot “if we,” “might,” “we would have to,” “I think,” and so on — this sounds like guessing. I would suggest to speak with clarity and offer a default recommendation backed by reasoning, for example: “Unless there’s a strong reason to keep it in the closet, I recommend the attic — it’s quieter, frees up space, and is easier to service.”</textarea>

          Okay, okay. All right. So the options I have are. Can I see the prices
          again? Yeah, so. So all of these are going to be great options for
          you.
          <strong>I do have to take this call. Feel free to review this. Hello? Okay,
            I'm still talking to our client here about different options. So I
            don't know.</strong>

          Yeah, I see that all these are. This one bent to the side. Yes. That's
          a big difference too, is amount of room taken up outside. These are
          going to be taller systems. So it is actually. You know what, it'll be
          very, very, really, really close to the same height, but they're like
          this thin. But they go. They go wide, though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But my
          experience with the other one is that it vents to the side, so it's
          kind of windy. It still will. It still will. Yeah. And what I like
          about this one is that it vents to the top. I. I can build a form of
          inverter that does do that. Yeah. If that's a. So they have these unit
          that bends upwards. Yep. The brand is Bosch. Very highly reviewed.
          Mostly actually highly reviewed from technicians, which is very cool.
          Technicians love working on them because they're very reliable. But I
          don't know where the Bosch would end up. But I do think it would be
          roughly in that same area. The only thing we can find out with Bosch
          in a second. But you see how this says Energy Star, high heat. Mm.
          Whenever you see Energy Star, that actually can qualify you for one
          further rebate that you have to deal with completely on your own. We
          can't help you. It's a tax cut rebate. And usually if you qualify for
          it, it's either a thousand dollars or $2,000. If we don't have Energy
          Star on it, you can't have that rebate. And Bosch doesn't have that. I
          can find out. Okay, okay, okay. Got it, got it. Want me to just find
          out real quick? Sure, sure. Okay. Let me just modify this estimate to
          be a Bosch, but leave that one there. I will. I'm just going to
          duplicate it and we'll switch it over to a Bosch. Okay. It does have
          Energy Star. So the difference is this one will have. It won't have
          the high heat feature. So let me just get. Where did I put that
          estimate as this one? Right. There we go. It. Okay. So now we have.
          It's funny. They all end up being in the same price range. So it's
          again, in regards to technology, the only thing that the Bryant has
          over the other ones is that it doesn't enter defrost as often. In
          California, though, we really don't enter. Are defrosting. I had a
          heat pump before in another place. Never had a problem with it. Yeah,
          20 years ago. And it was here in California. Yeah. So I think it's
          just. It will just very rarely enter a defrost cycle. But this one
          just has that better feature. Yeah, exactly.

          Yeah. Okay. Okay. And how long does it take to install the system? If
          we are doing a heat pump, it's going to be roughly two or three days.
          Because there is a lot of work that goes into a heat pump. If it was a
          gas system to existing ac, I would say one to two days. And then there
          is still a promotion. I haven't even included any of these. And that
          would be duct sealing. And those that also can take close to a day
          too. But depending on time frames, we have an install crew or two out
          here for you. If you have two, it really speeds up things. Things up.
          So that's either two guys or four guys. Okay. Okay. And all right. I
          understand the options. That's fine. I'm not. I would be interested
          on. On, on the heat pump. Maybe these, these two. I'm not interested
          on the gas. Sure. And I guess. And then the other thing I noticed is
          that you also have financing. I do, yeah. You go, so for financing,
          can you show me the monthly payment and for how long is that? So we
          have. We have. Let's go to the Bosch, since that's the one that you
          like the idea of having airflow up. We'll look at financing. So we'll
          look at wintime offers July. So these are just all of our options that
          we have. So we have 120 month, 8.99 interest with autopay. So you
          don't have to do anything. 180. So much longer term with 9.99. This is
          our most. These two are our most commonly used. Good leap, actually
          just barely just gave us access to this this month. It was supposed to
          end on the 15th, so I'm surprised it's still going on. But the 12
          months, no interest just means that if you do pay it off in 12 months,
          you just pay the same as cash. Like there's no interest rate or
          anything. This is just a very common one because the low interest rate
          and it just goes on for a little bit of a longer term. And yeah, I
          think when it comes to this one that we're seeing, when it comes to
          this payment that we're seeing there, that's including the 5.991 for
          this, for the 60 months. 60 months. 5 years of. 5 year 335. And that.
          That includes the promotions area. Yeah, there's still some line items
          in regards to promotions I haven't included. But this is baseline
          equipment. And what is the monthly payment with the one that you
          showed me that I can pay off earlier in a year, that type of one. So
          you don't need to pay anything for a full year if you don't want. You
          actually do have the ability to take a year off of payments entirely.
          But then if it goes to that, I think it's not a nasty interest rate.
          It's something around 10%. Oh, I see what you're saying. It's not a
          horrible, horrible interest rate, but there is an interest rate there,
          so. Oh. So basically paying the full amount within the year and
          whatever. But the nice thing is you don't need to pay anything for the
          year either. So if we did pay it off in 12 payments, let's say it
          would be a little bit over 2,000amonth. Because it's within a year.
          Within a year. But then I think the terms actually go really, really
          close. It's like four, five years of, I think 9.99 from there. But the
          nice thing though is let's say you don't pay it off in full. Let's say
          you go to the year and maybe you put 18,000 down. So we still have a
          remaining balance of. Still remaining balance of 8,422. What then
          happens is that interest only applies to that remaining balance. So we
          only get the remaining balance. So that would then divide it by. Yeah,
          so we just get that remaining amount and then divide it by 60. That
          would be like your monthly payment for five more years. But yeah, but
          then you can pay it off early and it's no big deal.

          Of course, I get it. Okay, so look, I like to speak with my wife about
          all the options. Email me these and then of course I'll. Let's cover
          the what you did today and then I'll just discuss this with my wife.
          Sure. Yeah. I like the idea of the thing being quieter and more
          efficient. Yeah. And not having gas leaks in the future. Yeah. So how
          about this? Let me bring the estimates down to just two of them. I'll
          just eliminate this one, eliminate that one.
          <strong>
            the only thing I just want to make sure is clear on my end it would
            be so much easier if I didn't have to charge for the repair today
            and if we actually just basically considered it as a complimentary
            thing for you. So if we did feel comfortable with signing what that
            would just look like on your end would just be a $1,000 down
            payment.</strong>
          The other thing is we can see what options you qualify for in regards
          to financing. And if that's the case, if we have financing, then I
          don't even need a down payment today. We would just do just the
          financing side of it. And we do come with. Every contractor that's
          reputable comes with this guarantee here. So as you're talking to your
          wife, anything weird comes up, we even have this notice right here. So
          we always have a reputable three day right to cancel.

          No, we won't do that today. Just send me the, I'll talk to her and
          then we'll make a decision. Absolutely. And then within 15 days I will
          completely credit that back towards it. Okay. So I'm gonna pretty his
          estimates up a little bit more and I'll include, include the duct
          sealing promotion. And because tech is needing a hers test, we
          actually just kind of have to do that anyways. So I'm going to modify
          it a little bit. And what you'll see that's new when I send it to you
          is permit and hers test. You'll see a duct seal cost. But then if you
          keep scrolling down, you would see a it credited back as a promotion,
          so. So, great. We'll go ahead. I'll eliminate the both of the gas
          options and we'll stay with the Bryant and the Bosch. Yes, and very
          cool. And let me go ahead and get the $1,000 for today. 1,900. So do
          you need a Visa or MasterCard? I think it's a MasterCard. If I can
          find it. Always important. There you go. Great. It's on the back.
